            <h2>About me</h2>
            <h5>A student from UiTM Kota Bharu Kelantan</h5>
        
        <p>I am Nur Ashrin Sofia Binti Ahmad Razali, and I embrace life with a excitement for exploration and personal growth. Born on August 19, 2001, in the beautiful city of Ipoh, Perak, I have been fortunate to embark on a journey filled with enriching experiences. My educational path began at SK Convent Ipoh, where I laid the foundation for my academic pursuits and nurtured a love for learning. Transitioning to SMK Convent Ipoh for my high school years, I faced new challenges and seized opportunities to broaden my horizons through extracurricular activities and diverse friendships.</p>
        <p>I am pursuing my degree at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), where I am eagerly immersing myself in various fields of study. This educational endeavor fuels my curiosity and equips me with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the dynamic world around me. The journey is not without its trials, but I am driven by an unwavering determination to succeed and make the most of the opportunities that come my way.</p>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have been blessed with the unwavering love and support of my family. As the youngest member, I have two incredible sisters, Nur Ashikin and Nur Fakihin Auni, who have been my pillars of strength. Their guidance, encouragement, and shared experiences have played a significant role in shaping the person I am today. Moreover, my family has been graced with the presence of a nephew and a niece, who bring immeasurable joy and remind me of the boundless love that exists within our close-knit circle.</p>
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits and family ties, I find solace in cherishing life's simplest pleasures. Whether it's witnessing the beauty of nature, engaging in creative endeavors, or spending quality time with loved ones, I am inspired to appreciate the present moment. Embracing life with a positive mindset, I strive to approach each day with enthusiasm and gratitude, recognizing that every experience is an opportunity for growth and self-discovery.
